Local build set up:
Create file in $HOME/.orders.key with contents: "testkey"

Running locally:
Either deploy the war with application.properties and log4j.properties included in an extra classpath, or run from local build with the test properties by running mvn initialize jetty:run

The application will run locally through a local build on http://localhost:8091/orders/test

Deployment:
Create a file in the home directoy of the user running the application: .orders.key with a complex password.
Change the permissions on this file to be readable only by the application user.

Create a production version of application.properties and log4j.properties based on the test copies.
Any property value in application.properties can be encrypted in the format: ENC("encrypted value"), you should have your database and Payment Gateway credentials encrypted at minimum.
The encryption algorithm being used is: PBEWITHSHA256AND128BITAES-CBC-BC
